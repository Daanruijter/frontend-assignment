# frontend-assignment
This repo contains javascript assignments which are tested for correctness but not for method. It also contains a design assignment based on HTML & SCSS.

### Starting
The assignment begins from reading this README. We expect you to have a base understanding of standard web development principles, including git and npm/yarn.
We also believe in documenting our code properly, this project is not an exception.

* Clone this repo
* Create a new branch titled `assignment-firstname-lastname`
* Install the project dependcies with yarn (or npm)
* Open the project, complete the `tasks` and run `yarn test` to see your progress

* If it wasn't given to you as a do-at-home, build the two design elements within the `web` folder using your chosen method

### Contents of repo
* `tasks` contains the tasks you need to complete
* `test` contains the test modules to verify the tasks work. You can ignore this.
